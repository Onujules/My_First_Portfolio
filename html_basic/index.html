            HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the language used to describe the structure of documents which are meant to be displayed on the web. To this effect, any content that you see on a website has some HTML code behind it.

        <h2>Document Structure in HTML</h2>

        <p>
            An HTML document is made up of several key parts: the <!DOCTYPE>, the <html> tag, the <head> section, and the <body> section. Each part has a special job, just like the different parts of a book.

        <h3>Metadata in HTML</h3>

        <p>
            Welcome to the world of metadata in HTML! Think of metadata like the secret instructions you give to a web browser. These instructions help the browser understand how to show your website, who made it, and even what it’s about. Let’s dive into three important types of metadata: meta tags, character set, and viewport.

            Meta tags are like little notes you leave inside your website’s code. These notes tell the web browser important things it needs to know. You put these tags in the <head> section of your HTML document, which is like the brain of your website.
